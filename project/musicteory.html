                <h1>Musical Theory</h1>
                <p>Musical theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. It is a comprehensive topic
                    that spans numerous aspects of music, including notation, scales, chords, and rhythm. Here, we will
                    cover the basics to get you started on your musical journey.</p>

                <h2>Musical Notation</h2>
                <p>Musical notation is a system used to visually represent aurally perceived music through the use of
                    written symbols. The main components of musical notation are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Staff:</strong> A set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a
                        different musical pitch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clefs:</strong> Symbols placed at the beginning of the staff to indicate the pitch of
                        the notes. The most common clefs are the treble clef and bass clef.</li>
                    <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Symbols that represent the pitch and duration of a sound. They are
                        placed on the staff to indicate which note should be played.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rests:</strong> Symbols that indicate a period of silence in the music.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Scales</h2>
                <p>A scale is a sequence of notes ordered by pitch. The most common scales in Western music are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Major Scale:</strong> A seven-note scale that is characterized by its bright and happy
                        sound. The formula for a major scale is W-W-H-W-W-W-H (where W is a whole step and H is a half
                        step).</li>
                    <li><strong>Minor Scale:</strong> A seven-note scale that is characterized by its dark and sad
                        sound. The formula for a natural minor scale is W-H-W-W-H-W-W.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Chords</h2>
                <p>Chords are groups of notes played together to create harmony. The most basic chords are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Major Chord:</strong> Consists of the root note, a major third, and a perfect fifth.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Minor Chord:</strong> Consists of the root note, a minor third, and a perfect fifth.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Rhythm</h2>
                <p>Rhythm is the pattern of sounds and silences in music. The main components of rhythm are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Beat:</strong> The basic unit of time in music.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meter:</strong> The grouping of beats into regular patterns, such as 4/4 or 3/4 time.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Tempo:</strong> The speed at which a piece of music is played, usually measured in beats
                        per minute (BPM).</li>
                </ul>
